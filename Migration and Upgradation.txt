Upgradation:
Upgradation involves overwriting existing SQL Server instance and upgrading from one version to another version.

Migration:
Migration involves moving data (databases/objects) between homogenous and heterogenous SQL Server instances and also to other RDBMS softwares.

Reasons of Upgradation:
1) Upgrading between versions.
2) Upgrading with a Service Pack
3) Upgrading from one edition to another.

Reasons of Migration:
1) Upgrading server hardware  (from old server to new server)
2) OS Upgradation
3) Upgrading to a newer version
4) Moving databases from one drive to another drive
5) Moving data between different RDBMS
6) 32-Bit to 64-Bit is Migration.
7) Prod-QA/Dev refresh activity 


Different ways of Migration:
1) Backup and Restore
2) Detach and Attach
3) Copy Database Wizard
4) Import/Export
5) BCP

Difference between Upgrade/Migrate:
Upgrade is change of state i.e. from 
i)  Version to another version
ii) Edition to another edition
iii)License upgrade
iv) Service Pack upgrade

Migration is moving from one location to another location and also between versions. Migration means moving a database from one server to another, or from one drive to another.

Migrate a database from
i)   2000 to 2005 instance
ii)  2005 to 2008 instance
iii) 2008 to 2012 instance

Upgradation/Migration can be implemented in kind of two ways:

1) Inplace Upgrade
2) Side-by-Side Migrate

Inplace Upgrade is overwriting an existing instance to new instance. 

Side-by-Side upgrade is minimal downtime, a new instance is built in parallel to the existing instance. Once tested the new instance is released.

In-Place Upgrade Steps:
1) Take a backup for safety measure (All Databases)
2) Run Upgrade Advisor to detect any potential issues during upgradation
3) Check the 32-bit or 64-bit version of SQL Server 2005 instance
4) Launch the SQL Server 2008 installation and select Upgrade SQL Server instance 2000 or 2005 option.
5) Select the instance to upgrade and complete Inplace upgrade from 2005 to 2008.
